## 🗣️ About Me

I believe theory is meaningless without experience. Over the years, I’ve learned that caching, naming variables and streams are the hardest things in software engineering, not to mention Terraform and recovering from longgg meetings. I thrive on solving real-world problems and enjoy building solutions for cloud platforms, market data, and automation.

- **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**
- **Core Volunteer** at Python.PH, Inc.

- **Remote-first** advocate (no recruiter can tempt me with an office return!)
